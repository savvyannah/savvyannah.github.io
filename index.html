<p>
Bringing visions to life is a passion of mine, given that I have been a clairvoyant for my whole life.
</p>
<p>
I have actively embraced my gifts in the last two decades, ensuring that I allow myself to get to know my gifts and enhancing the best ways to use them in order to help others.
</p>
<p>
I have been a <a href="http://www.healingsandreadings.com.au/healings">Reiki</a> practitioner since 2006, and a master for more than four years. I have combined this with my intuitive knowledge of crystals and affirmations to bring about my <a href="http://www.healingsandreadings.com.au/aqualight">Aqualight Vibrational Crystal Drops</a> range, which I have created to help people remove blocks in their lives and continue on their journey with comfort and happiness.
</p>
<p>
One of my favourite tools of the trade are <a href="http://www.healingsandreadings.com.au/readings">Oracle cards and Tarot cards</a>, which allow me to connect with spirits using my "clairs".
</p>
<p>
Since 2011 I have widened my client base, and have started teaching children how to use affirmations and meditation in their lives. This has been particularly rewarding as I have received some amazing feedback and have seen many beautiful changes, with children becoming more confident within themselves after spending time in my workshops.
</p>
<p>
In 2012 I completed training with Doreen Virtue and Radleigh Valentine to become a certified Angel Card Reader, which has further heightened my abilities.
</p>
<p>
I am passionate about my gifts, and experience great satisfaction knowing the spiritual connections I can bring to my clients.
</p>
<p>
I feel so fortunate to bear my gifts, and I hope that my clients feel similarly rewarded during our sessions.
